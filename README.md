Records some kinda useful problems here.

For math problems, use `(`[`~r`](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/strings.html?q=~r#%28def._%28%28lib._racket%2Fformat..rkt%29._~7er%29%29)` num #:precision x)` (cheat) to reduce digits ie  
`(string->number (~r pi #:precision 2)) -> 3.14`

The numerical approximation might be able to satisfy engineering needs.

Now I support a window (very classic) to do the calculations!!!
